Introduction
================

This project is for scriptizing daily IT work about CentOS.
Currently we only support CentOS 7 since it's my main working platform.
I may add support for higher version when it comes out.
But there's no plan for supporting pre-7 versions.

Features
================

* Docker sandbox
* Bare metal deployment
* Git repositoies mirroring
* Yum repositoies mirroring
